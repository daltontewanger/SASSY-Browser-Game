            <h2>Welcome to the Strawberry Kingdom!</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>
              Once upon a berry-luscious time, you reigned as the mighty lord of
              strawberries, revered by all. But alas, a bitter twist of fate
              stripped you of your powers! Now, the very strawberries you once
              ruled see you as a mere mortal and are launching a fruity
              rebellion against you. To reclaim your title as the almighty lord
              of strawberries, you must devour them to regain your strength and
              emerge victorious!
            </p>
            <h3>Controls:</h3>
            <p>
              Use the arrow keys to navigate your character. Be cautious,
              though; your speed increases rapidly and slows gradually. Your
              character seamlessly traverses the screen's edges, so exercise
              precision to maintain control.
            </p>
            <h3>Strawberry Shenanigans:</h3>
            <p>
              Strawberries of varying sizes emerge from all sides of the screen.
              Only munch on those smaller than you to thrive. The closer their
              size matches yours, the greater your reward. However, avoid
              strawberries larger than you at all costs—they spell your
              downfall.
              <br />
              <br />
              Time to gobble up those strawberries and seize your berry kingdom
              once more!
